// related tabs at once. Covers every imported spreadsheet tab except two
// generic catch-all sheets ("More resources", "Resources by category
// questions") that don't fit a specific topic — those are still reachable
// via the free-text search box.
// Each filter also lists which business waste-type tags it's actually
// related to (relatedWasteTypes), so selecting a curated category also
// shows businesses whose own waste_types tags overlap with it, instead of
// hiding every business outright. Categories with no real waste-type
// equivalent (Policy & Advocacy, Youth & Education, etc.) just show no
// businesses — that's correct, not a bug.
